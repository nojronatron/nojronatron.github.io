# Notes from Duckett HTML and JS Books

Notes taken from Ducketts HTML and CSS book while
skimming Chapters on HTML Images, CSS Color and Text.

## Chapter 5: Images (pg.94)

Images can add interest to your website.
The book suggests the following *[Duckett, pg.97]*

> Be relevant
> Convey  information
> Convey the right mood
> Be instantly recognizable
> Fit the color palette

Stock photos are available, usually for a price, from many sources, Duckett suggests a few:

> [iStockPhoto](https://www.istockphoto.com)  
> [GettyImages](https://www.gettyimages.com)  
> [Veer](https://www.veer.com)  
> [SXC](https://www.sxc.hu)  
> [Fotolia](https://www.fotolia.com)  

Configure your website with separate folder(s) for the site images.

### Img Tag

```html
<img src="url" alt="text for screen readers" 
  title="text to display when hovered over (tooltip)"
  height="" width="" />
```

*Note*: Either height or width is helpful, but using both or neither could cause unexpected results.  
*Note^2*: More commonly, dimensions of an image are defined in CSS.

#### Image Placement

Block-level elements following an `<img>` element will always appear on a new line.  
When `<img>` is within a block-level element, inline elements will flow *around* the image.  

*Note*: AVOID using align properties with settings: left, right, top, middle, or bottom.

#### Image Formatting

Use the following formats:  

- jpeg: Supports many colors, especially subtle color/shade changes in an image.  
- gif: Best used for solid/same color images, or those with very little gradients.  
- png: Similar to gif, is better for images with few colors covering large areas.  
- svg: Scalable Vector Graphics.  
  - An output of Adobe Illustrator, generated by connecting dots and lines to create the image.  
  - Usually a bitmap version is stored for use on the web.  

Use a sensible image size:  

Same dimensions of the target dimensions within the website.  

- Downsize the filesize by reducing image size by high percentages.  
- Upsizing an image will result in a poor quality, fuzzy or distorted image.  
- Carefully change shape so as to not lose important information in the image e.g. portrait to landscape.  

Set the units of measurement to the screen:  

- Use px (pixels) for the best possible rendering.  
- Do not worry about the resolution of the picture as much as the dimensions in pixels.  


Commonly used tools, and those suggested by the author, in no particular order *[Duckett, pg.108]*

> Adobe Fireworks
> Pixelmator
> PaintShop Pro
> Paint.net
> [Photoshp](https://www.photoshop.com)
> [Pixlr](https://www.pixlr.com)
> [SplashUp](https://www.splashup.com)
> [Ipiccy](https://www.ipiccy.com)

### Animations

Adobe Photoshop has tools to create animated GIFs.  
Animated GIFs are made of strung-together static images.  
Animated GIFs can increase the time it takes for a web page to load fully.  
Usually reserved for simple animations, not high-quality images or motion effect.  

### Transparency and Shadows

Transparent GIFs:

"If the transparent part of the image has straight edges and it is 100% transparent (that is, not semi-opaque), you can save the image as a GIF (with the transparency option selected)." *[Duckett, pg.118]*  

Transparent PNGs:

"If the transparent part of the image has diagonal or rounded edges or if you want a semi-opaque transparency or a drop-shadow, then you will need to save it as a PNG." *[Duckett, pg.118]*

*Note*: Not all browsers, especially older ones, fully support transparent PNGs.  

### Captioning Images

Use the following elements to enclose images and caption them:

`<figure>`
`<figcaption>`

Older browsers ignore these tags but will still display the content within and around them.  

## Chapter 11: Color (pg.246)

Color is another "grabber" feature of a web page - it can really get the attention of your users.  

### Specifing Color

Several ways to specify colors:  

- Somewhat plain-english names like 'blue', 'grey', 'gray', 'red', and 'green'.  
- RGB values i.e. `rgb(105, 220, 78)`  
- Hex codes i.e. `#07a85c`  

These color specifiers can be applied to:

- color: Foreground color e.g. `<h1>` or content.  
- background-color e.g. `<body>`, `<section>` or `<p>`.  

### Color Terminology and Contrast

Colors are displayed on computer monitors by using a color or hue, and saturation and brightness:
> Color: RGB, Hex, or Color Name
> Hue: An alternate to Color; think of the colors of a rainbow.  
> Saturation: The amount of grey that is in the color.  
> Brightness: The amount of black that is in the color.  

Contrast: Text can become illegible in low-contrast styling arrangements. Ensure the contrast is high enough to make the content stand out without being too "strong" for the message or theme of the website.  

Opacity: New in CSS3, it can be set using a value between 0.0 and 1.0, or using a 4th setting in rgb(r, g, b, opacity).  

### CSS3 HSL Colors and HSLA

HSL is composed of:

- Hue: Color, as in colors of the rainbow.  
- Saturation: Amount of grey in the color.  
- Lightness: Amount of *white* in the color (the opposite of Brightness, btw).  

HSLA includes one more:

- Alpha: Transparency.  

HSL and HSLA Usage:

```css
body {
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 78%);
}
p {
  background-color: hsla(0, 100%, 100%, 0.5);
}
```

*Work Around For Old Browsers*: Since the final element setting will take precedence, and older browsers do not recognize the opacity setting in the RGB property specification, enter the backward-compatiby rgb(r, g, b) setting first, followed by the newer rgb(r, g, b, opacity) setting, the latter of which will be applied by newer browsers, and ignored by older ones.  

## Chapter 12: Text (pg.264)

Two groups of properties for controlling text style:

1. Directly affect the font itself: size, typeface, bold, italicized.
2. Other non-font-specific alterations: color, spacing, etc.

Controlling fonts and styles of text directly impact the beauty of your website.  

Typefaces:

- serif: Has tails on line ends.  
- sans-serif: Without tails.  
- monospace: regardless of the letter width, each character takes the exact same amount of space.  

Font adjustments:  

- Weight  
- Style  
- Stretch  

Font Limitations:  

- Must be installed in the site visitor's browser (many are by default).  
- Cursive or Fantasy styled fonts might not be in alignment with the theme and goals of the website.  
- Typefaces are subject to copyright, so if you are *distributing* a typeface font, be sure to look at rights and limitations of doing so.  

### Font Properties and Settings

font-family:

- Pick a list of families, starting with most specific, and ending with the most widely available.  
- Stick with a list of fonts that are of the same typeface.
- End the list with the most generic typeface category names: monospace, sans-serif, or serif.  
- `@font-face`: Allows picking a non-installed font by identifying a src url for the typeface.  

font-size:

- 12 or 16-pixel scale. Moniker: px  
- Percentages. Moniker: '%'  
- EMS: Think of these as one 100^th of a percentage. Moniker: 'em'  

font-weight:  

- normal: Reset a parent-set font-weight to the 'normal' weight settings.
- bold

font-style:  

- normal  
- italic: If typeface doesn't have an italic style, browser applies oblique instead.  
- oblique: A calculated slane to a 'normal' font style. Browsers support doing this natively for missing italic styles.  

text-decoration:  

- none: Removes a previously applied decoration.  
- underline:  
- overline: Adds a line over the top of the text.  
- line-through:  
- blink:  

Spacings:  

- line-height: Vertical relief between text characters.  
- letter-spacing and word-spacing: Horizontal space between characters, and words, respectively.  

text-align: One and only one of these:  

- left, or  
- right, or  
- center, or  
- justify  

vertical-align:

Used when adding text near an 'img' tag.
Moves text up or down within the box neighboring another element.  

- baseline  
- sub  
- super  
- top  
- text-top  
- middle  
- bottom  
- text-bottom  
- length and percentage (of line height) can also be used.  

text-indent:

Indents the *first line of text*.  
Accepts px units.  

text-shadow:  

There are four properties to set on this rule, e.g. *[Duckett, pg.288]*:  

```css
p.one {
  //
  text-shadow: 1px 1px 0px #000000;
}
```

1. Shadow fall left or right.  
2. Shadow fall top or bottom.  
3. Blur amount to apply (optional).  
4. Shadowing color.  

*Note*: Possible browser support problems with this rule.  

First Letter or Line

`:first-letter`, `:first-line`  

These 'pseudo-elements' apply to the first-letter of a line or the first-line of a block of text.  

Usage:

```css
p.pOne: first-letter{
  font-size: 2em;
}
```

Styling Links

`:link`, '`:visited`  

Usage:

```css
a:link {
  color: blue;
}
a:visited {
  color: red;
}
```

Responding to Users  

`:hover`, `:active`, `:focus`  

Define what happens to elements with certain user actions.  

### Attribute Selectors

Existence: Attribute matcher `element[string]`: `p[class]` selects all p elements with a 'class' attribute.  
Equality: Matches `element[comparer]` selects elements with 'attribute=string'.  
Space: Matches elements that contain a space-separated word `element[attribute ~= string]`.  
Prefix: Matches attribute by starting string `element[attribute ^= "string"]`.  
Substring: Matches attribute by substring `element[attribute *= "string"]`.  
Suffix: Matches attribute with ending value `element[attribute $= "string"]`.

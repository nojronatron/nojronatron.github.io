# Notes from Duckett HTML and JS Books

Notes taken from Ducketts HTML and CSS book while
skimming Chapters on HTML Images, CSS Color and Text.

## Chapter 5: Images (pg.94)

Images can add interest to your website.
The book suggests the following *[Duckett, pg.97]*

> Be relevant
> Convey  information
> Convey the right mood
> Be instantly recognizable
> Fit the color palette

Stock photos are available, usually for a price, from many sources, Duckett suggests a few:

> [iStockPhoto](https://www.istockphoto.com)  
> [GettyImages](https://www.gettyimages.com)  
> [Veer](https://www.veer.com)  
> [SXC](https://www.sxc.hu)  
> [Fotolia](https://www.fotolia.com)  

Configure your website with separate folder(s) for the site images.

### Img Tag

```html
<img src="url" alt="text for screen readers" 
  title="text to display when hovered over (tooltip)"
  height="" width="" />
```

*Note*: Either height or width is helpful, but using both or neither could cause unexpected results.  
*Note^2*: More commonly, dimensions of an image are defined in CSS.

#### Image Placement

Block-level elements following an `<img>` element will always appear on a new line.  
When `<img>` is within a block-level element, inline elements will flow *around* the image.  

*Note*: AVOID using align properties with settings: left, right, top, middle, or bottom.

#### Image Formatting

Use the following formats:  

- jpeg: Supports many colors, especially subtle color/shade changes in an image.  
- gif: Best used for solid/same color images, or those with very little gradients.  
- png: Similar to gif, is better for images with few colors covering large areas.  
- svg: Scalable Vector Graphics.  
  - An output of Adobe Illustrator, generated by connecting dots and lines to create the image.  
  - Usually a bitmap version is stored for use on the web.  

Use a sensible image size:  

Same dimensions of the target dimensions within the website.  

- Downsize the filesize by reducing image size by high percentages.  
- Upsizing an image will result in a poor quality, fuzzy or distorted image.  
- Carefully change shape so as to not lose important information in the image e.g. portrait to landscape.  

Set the units of measurement to the screen:  

- Use px (pixels) for the best possible rendering.  
- Do not worry about the resolution of the picture as much as the dimensions in pixels.  


Commonly used tools, and those suggested by the author, in no particular order *[Duckett, pg.108]*

> Adobe Fireworks
> Pixelmator
> PaintShop Pro
> Paint.net
> [Photoshp](https://www.photoshop.com)
> [Pixlr](https://www.pixlr.com)
> [SplashUp](https://www.splashup.com)
> [Ipiccy](https://www.ipiccy.com)

### Animations

Adobe Photoshop has tools to create animated GIFs.  
Animated GIFs are made of strung-together static images.  
Animated GIFs can increase the time it takes for a web page to load fully.  
Usually reserved for simple animations, not high-quality images or motion effect.  

### Transparency and Shadows

Transparent GIFs:

"If the transparent part of the image has straight edges and it is 100% transparent (that is, not semi-opaque), you can save the image as a GIF (with the transparency option selected)." *[Duckett, pg.118]*  

Transparent PNGs:

"If the transparent part of the image has diagonal or rounded edges or if you want a semi-opaque transparency or a drop-shadow, then you will need to save it as a PNG." *[Duckett, pg.118]*

*Note*: Not all browsers, especially older ones, fully support transparent PNGs.  

### Captioning Images

Use the following elements to enclose images and caption them:

`<figure>`
`<figcaption>`

Older browsers ignore these tags but will still display the content within and around them.

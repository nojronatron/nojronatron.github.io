# Notes from Duckett HTML and JS Books

Notes taken from Ducketts HTML and CSS book while
skimming Chapters on HTML Images, CSS Color and Text.

## Chapter 5: Images (pg.94)

Images can add interest to your website.
The book suggests the following *[Duckett, pg.97]*

> Be relevant
> Convey  information
> Convey the right mood
> Be instantly recognizable
> Fit the color palette

Stock photos are available, usually for a price, from many sources, Duckett suggests a few:

> [iStockPhoto](https://www.istockphoto.com)  
> [GettyImages](https://www.gettyimages.com)  
> [Veer](https://www.veer.com)  
> [SXC](https://www.sxc.hu)  
> [Fotolia](https://www.fotolia.com)  

Configure your website with separate folder(s) for the site images.

### Img Tag

```html
<img src="url" alt="text for screen readers" 
  title="text to display when hovered over (tooltip)"
  height="" width="" />
```

*Note*: Either height or width is helpful, but using both or neither could cause unexpected results.  
*Note^2*: More commonly, dimensions of an image are defined in CSS.

#### Image Placement

Block-level elements following an `<img>` element will always appear on a new line.  
When `<img>` is within a block-level element, inline elements will flow *around* the image.  

*Note*: AVOID using align properties with settings: left, right, top, middle, or bottom.

#### Image Formatting

Use the following formats:  

- jpeg: Supports many colors, especially subtle color/shade changes in an image.  
- gif: Best used for solid/same color images, or those with very little gradients.  
- png: Similar to gif, is better for images with few colors covering large areas.  
- svg: Scalable Vector Graphics.  
  - An output of Adobe Illustrator, generated by connecting dots and lines to create the image.  
  - Usually a bitmap version is stored for use on the web.  

Use a sensible image size:  

Same dimensions of the target dimensions within the website.  

- Downsize the filesize by reducing image size by high percentages.  
- Upsizing an image will result in a poor quality, fuzzy or distorted image.  
- Carefully change shape so as to not lose important information in the image e.g. portrait to landscape.  

Set the units of measurement to the screen:  

- Use px (pixels) for the best possible rendering.  
- Do not worry about the resolution of the picture as much as the dimensions in pixels.  


Commonly used tools, and those suggested by the author, in no particular order *[Duckett, pg.108]*

> Adobe Fireworks
> Pixelmator
> PaintShop Pro
> Paint.net
> [Photoshp](https://www.photoshop.com)
> [Pixlr](https://www.pixlr.com)
> [SplashUp](https://www.splashup.com)
> [Ipiccy](https://www.ipiccy.com)

### Animations

Adobe Photoshop has tools to create animated GIFs.  
Animated GIFs are made of strung-together static images.  
Animated GIFs can increase the time it takes for a web page to load fully.  
Usually reserved for simple animations, not high-quality images or motion effect.  

### Transparency and Shadows

Transparent GIFs:

"If the transparent part of the image has straight edges and it is 100% transparent (that is, not semi-opaque), you can save the image as a GIF (with the transparency option selected)." *[Duckett, pg.118]*  

Transparent PNGs:

"If the transparent part of the image has diagonal or rounded edges or if you want a semi-opaque transparency or a drop-shadow, then you will need to save it as a PNG." *[Duckett, pg.118]*

*Note*: Not all browsers, especially older ones, fully support transparent PNGs.  

### Captioning Images

Use the following elements to enclose images and caption them:

`<figure>`
`<figcaption>`

Older browsers ignore these tags but will still display the content within and around them.  

## Chapter 11: Color (pg.246)

Color is another "grabber" feature of a web page - it can really get the attention of your users.  

### Specifing Color

Several ways to specify colors:  

- Somewhat plain-english names like 'blue', 'grey', 'gray', 'red', and 'green'.  
- RGB values i.e. `rgb(105, 220, 78)`  
- Hex codes i.e. `#07a85c`  

These color specifiers can be applied to:

- color: Foreground color e.g. `<h1>` or content.  
- background-color e.g. `<body>`, `<section>` or `<p>`.  

### Color Terminology and Contrast

Colors are displayed on computer monitors by using a color or hue, and saturation and brightness:
> Color: RGB, Hex, or Color Name
> Hue: An alternate to Color; think of the colors of a rainbow.  
> Saturation: The amount of grey that is in the color.  
> Brightness: The amount of black that is in the color.  

Contrast: Text can become illegible in low-contrast styling arrangements. Ensure the contrast is high enough to make the content stand out without being too "strong" for the message or theme of the website.  

Opacity: New in CSS3, it can be set using a value between 0.0 and 1.0, or using a 4th setting in rgb(r, g, b, opacity).  

### CSS3 HSL Colors and HSLA

HSL is composed of:

- Hue: Color, as in colors of the rainbow.  
- Saturation: Amount of grey in the color.  
- Lightness: Amount of *white* in the color (the opposite of Brightness, btw).  

HSLA includes one more:

- Alpha: Transparency.  

HSL and HSLA Usage:

```css
body {
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 78%);
}
p {
  background-color: hsla(0, 100%, 100%, 0.5);
}
```

*Work Around For Old Browsers*: Since the final element setting will take precedence, and older browsers do not recognize the opacity setting in the RGB property specification, enter the backward-compatiby rgb(r, g, b) setting first, followed by the newer rgb(r, g, b, opacity) setting, the latter of which will be applied by newer browsers, and ignored by older ones.  

## Chapter 12: Text (pg.264)

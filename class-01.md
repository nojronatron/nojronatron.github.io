# Summarized topics

## From the Duckett HTML book

- Introduction (pp.2-11)
The internet is a global network connecting computers together. Computers have unique IP addresses (like a home street address) allowing other computers to find them. A naming system called DNS is like a directory that provides a lookup of human-readable names like www.microsoft.com into ip addresses like 192.168.123.10. Web servers on the internet are like special file servers, hosting special files that web browsers can process and display on a users screen. Web browsers interpret HTML to display text on the page, arranging text elements into different parts of the page or with different styles. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to describe the layout and design details of the web page to a greater degree than HTML can do. CSS can change website colors, text properties like fonts and colors, and more. HTML5 is the latest revision of the HTML specifications.

- HTML Chapter 1: “Structure” (pp.12-39)
HTML pages are comprised of plain-text documents decorated with HTML Tags and HTML Elements. HTML Tags are identified '<' and '>' and are usually in pairs. An opening tag example is `<head>`. A closing tag example is `</p>`. Between opening and closing tags is where content lies, for example: `<h1>Header H1</h1>`. Pairs of HTML tags are refered to as Elements.
Attributes are key-value pairs that help describe content stored within HTML elements. An example attribute is `lang='en-us'` *[Duckett, pg.25]*.

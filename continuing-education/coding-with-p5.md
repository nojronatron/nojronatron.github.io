1. Reference the P5js CDN within a script tag.
2. Also reference a local js file (e.g. `scetch.js`) in a separate script tag.

### About P5 With VSCode

- The draw loop: Continuously draws the page based on inputs within the `draw()` function.
- Install LivePreview Extension to see immediate results (P5js just runs as a webapp).
- P5 focuses on Accessibility e.g. `Describe()` enables visual representations of what is happening on-screen.
- Changing the visual design in P5 is really a matter of selecting a different vector object. Dan's example was changing circles to text.

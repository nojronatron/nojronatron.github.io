# Notes About ChatGPT and Language Learning Models

## Meetup Live Intro to ChatGPT

Host: Luigi Iacobellis: Trainer, YouTube Content Creator.

Topic: Write, Code, and Brainstorm using ChatGPT.

### What is ChatGPT

Designed to simulate human conversation.

- Built by OpenAI
- Public release Nov 2022
- Text-only
- Premium version (paid subscription) features better performance, newer models, priority access, expanded character/word input limitation

How to use?

1. Login
2. Enter a Query
3. Read the provided response

How does ChatGPT word?

- Language Models
- Model: "Generative Pre-Trained Transformer" :arrow_right: GPT
- Go to OpenAI website for more details
- Natural Language Processing: Breaks down input, analyzes them, then generates a response based on contexts

Reinforcement Learning:

- Human AI Trainers work with the model to teach it how to act

Limitations?

- Responses will be limited to information based on _when training ended_ and nothing newer
- May produce biased responses
- May produce incorrect information

### Google Bard

- Similar technology.
- Does _not_ include reinforcement training.
- Arguably not as capable as ChatGPT.

### ChatGPT Demo Notes

Access ChatGPT: chat.openai.com (an account is required)

Send a Message input field: Where to enter prompts and queries.

Usage is predicated on inputing a prompt. A Stop button is available, and the chat session can be saved.

Use Cases:

- Social Content Creation: Webinar or Event descriptions.
- Brainstorming: Coming up with ideas or refining existing ideas into an actionable plan. Dinner ideas based on ingredients on-hand or types of food.
- Help Summarize Information: Supply diverse information and ask ChatGPT for a synthesis or summary.
- Analyze quantitative information: Paste a prompt with table-data (CSV etc) and ask for a summary, to get a narrative based on analysis of the data.
- Provide solutions specific to applications e.g. Excel to get a usable formula to use in your own spreadsheet without divulging any data from the table.
- Transcription Summary: Paste transcription into the query and ask for a summary. Note: There might be a limitation to the number of characters (possibly 500 words or 4000 characters).

### Microsoft

Developed a partnership with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT into various products.

Edge:

- Click Bing icon then seelct :arrow_right: Chat | Compose | Insights
- Chat: Chat-bot style interaction within the Edge browser w/ responses direct from OpenAI free-tier Chat-GPT.
- Compose: Ask for support writing a message. Tone and style can be selected to fit a response for the purpose.
- Insights: Was not demoed.

### Tips

- When writing prompts, be more specific. More information in prompts to get better responses.
- OpenAI has a Discord Server where feedback can be submitted.
- Filler-text can be added into a query, and ChatGPT will skip over it and use the given context to generate a response.
- Group your questions in similar threads. Similarly, split longer and more complex prompts into multiple queries for more effective results.
- Trust but verify! Review output carefully.
- Provide as much detail into the prompt so the deep analysis on word matches will result in a better response.
- Tell ChatGPT to provide additional information, or use 'Regenerate Response' to get an alternative response.

#### One Thing Learned During Lui's Prez

The free tier of Chat GPT has many capabilities that I can use to:

- Simplify coming up with dinner ideas.
- Generate descriptions for planning documents for the volunteer radio team.

ChatGPT is integrated into Edge browser with a fully featured UI in a slide-out bar.

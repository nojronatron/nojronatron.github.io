# Azure Friday: Deploy Nodejs to Kubernetes

## Overview

Configure your own cluster.
VSCode will find one of yours and deploy to it.

Create Kubernetes Cluster plugin: Allows configuring a specific Kubernetes cluster to deploy to.

Kubernetes VSCode Extension:

- Explain feature: Describes the purpose of json elements, links to git repo, etc.
- Allows viewing the actual container that is running.
- Views the folder structure of the Kubernetes cluster including configuration files, etc.
- Breakpoints are available for Node.js debugging.
- Terminal: Context is pegged to the connected Kubernetes instance (your locally installed apps won't run if they aren't in the instance).
- Deployed instance can be deleted, updated, redeployed etc via VSCode.

    "1. Meet the requirements: Latest .NET SDK, .NET Interactive, and the Polyglot Notebooks Extension.\n",
    "2. Open the Command Palette and type: `Polyglot Notebook` and select an available command such as \"Create new blank notebook\" or \"Open Notebook\". You can also start and stop the underlying Notebook Kernels.\n",
    "3. When creating new, select a file format `.dib` or `.ipynb`, then select preferred language.\n",
    "4. Select a Kernel. The .NET Interactive Kernel provides data sharing features, and multi-lingual support.\n",
    "5. Add a Code Cell: Click `+ Code` on-screen. Start adding code to the code cell.\n",
    "6. Run a Code Cell: Click the play :arrow_forward: button.\n",
    "7. Clear output of cells: Click the waste basket :waste_basket: button.\n",
    "8. Output a value: End the script with an Expression (an assigned variable name without a semicolon) at the end of the code cell.\n",
    "9. Input a value from another Code Cell to another: `#!set --value @csharp:name --name name` where name is the literal name of the value in the _other_ Code Cell, and the name of the variable now available in the _current_ Code Cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore Polyglot Notebooks features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variable sharing: Output an Expression in one Code Cell for other Code Cells to use.\n",
    "- Commands: Various functions help with displaying data. `name.Display()` will display the value of `name`.\n",
    "- Mermaid: Render charts and diagrams.\n",
    "- File Format `.dib`: Plain text file type. Does not store output values, so is safe for outputting API Keys and other secret values.\n",
    "- File Format `.ipynb`: Plain text file type. Retains input cells and stores output. Simpler to share files with others. Users receiving files _do not have to run code cells_ to see results.\n",
    "- Magic Commands: Get the Time, connect a data source, or share code cell values. Prefix code with `#!` followed by the command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polyglot Notebooks Terminology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cells: Represent blocks of differing content such as code or markdown.\n",

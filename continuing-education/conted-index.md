### Notes And Takeaways from Research and Experience

- [X] Windows Subsystem for Linux [WSL Notes](./windows-subsystem-for-linux.html).

- [X] Handling [Errors in ExpressJS](./express-error-handling.html). I am implementing this in a live API server instance and there is work still to do.
- [X] Study Auth0 [Client Credentials Flow](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/call-your-api-using-the-client-credentials-flow), to prepare for possible Auth0 implementation for LingoBingo v.Next.
- [X] Using 'cursor' in Java: [Cursor and Iterators](./java-cursor-iterators.html).
- [X] When and why would I [choose to develop in](./choosing-a-language.html) Java vs C# or Python e.g. for a project.
- [X] Deploy [Express.js to Azure](deploy-express-mongodb-azure.html).
- [X] [Auth0 with Express.js](express-auth0-notes.html).
- [X] Research [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth) and [Firebase Google Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) as a possible alternative to Auth0. See notes at [firebase-auth](./firebase-auth.html).
- [X] React [useContext](./react-use-context-overview.md).

- [X] Review 301 class notes regarding React, State, Props, and Components.
- [X] Review Javascript "hoisting". This is related to the 2-pass setup and execution behavior of Javascript as runtime initializes.
- [X] How to implement [Style and Themes](../code401-files/android-themes.html) to your Android App.

- [X] [Handling exceptions and exception types](../code401-files/java-exceptions-scanner.html) in asynchronous programming in Java.  
- [X] JUnit Tests: Why do they pass by default, without asserts or any code? They would always fail otherwise.

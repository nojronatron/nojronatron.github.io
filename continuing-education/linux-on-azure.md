## General Notes

There was a claim that PowerShell is only used within the Microsoft ecosystem. This is not true:

- PowerShell can be installed on some [Linux Distros](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux?view=powershell-7.3)
- PowerShell for [Ubuntu 18, 20, and 22](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/install-ubuntu?view=powershell-7.3).

WSL now uses a full Linux Kernel (announced 2019) using a managed virtual machine.

Linux is the most popular IaaS deployment in Azure.

- Over 50% VM cores are linux-based.
- Over 60% Azure Marketplace images are linux-based.
- Over 47k customers using Azure open-source databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, CosmosDB).

Learn Bash for cloud?

- Bash is useful at the lowest level of abstraction.
- Bash is also useful at the VM level.
- Bash is helpful at the AKS/Container-level of cloud.
- Bash can be used at the ACA-level of cloud.

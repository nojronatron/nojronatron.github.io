### SS Getting Started

Creating a new site:

- Pick a specific template for yourself.
- SS will ask questions to select a template for you, however it might not be what you want.
- Templates are just a starting place.
- Template pre-define Style, Layout, Fonts, and Colors, but these can be customized.

Questions:

> Is it possible to build a site without a template?

### SS Design Tools

Views:

- Desktop and mobile viewing switcher.
- Build in one view, update in both views to tweak UX.

Search:

- Search tools within other tools exist to find a specific one.
- Use the `/` key to bring-up the search tool at any time.

Fonts:

- There are millions to choose from.
- Ligatures, weight, etc can be customized during design time.
- Font Packs: Contain pairs of "complimentary" fonts.
- Font overlap between SS and Canva, simplifying Canva-to-SS design and deployment.

Template Color Palettes:

- Presets: Contain some reasonable palettes with 6 (or so) shades of "complimentary" colors.
- From Image: Will choose a palette of colors based on an uploaded image.
- Custom Picker: Select your own colors and shades and assign to the palette.
- Other Colors: Modify an existing color and set as a palette color for this site.

> Do Color Presets utilize Accessible Design Practices?

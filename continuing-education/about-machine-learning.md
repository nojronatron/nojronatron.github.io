Introduction to Machine Learning

## About AI and ML

Artificial Intelligence (AI): Science of getting machines to accomplish tasks that typically require human level experience and skills.

Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI

Deep Learning: A further class of AI and ML, beyond the scope of this writup.

## Classical Machine Learning

Why use it?

- Calculate likelihood of upcoming events or medical conditions.
- Anticipate weather events.
- Understand sentiments of a writing.
- Detect propaganda or untrue statements and informational.

### ML Core Concepts

### ML History

- Started in 1950's.
- Alan Turing: Develop a machine that can "think". Turing Test can help determine difference between human and non-human responses to inputs.
- Golden Years: 1956 to 1974 :arrow_right: Optimism was high and government funding helped develop AI.
- One development was Eliza: Early text-based chat-bot / therapist.
- AI Winter in 1980's: Funding dried up, and personal computers competed with large AI-targeted systems.
- Rise of Internet and Smart Phones helped make large data-set processing possible.
- Big Data: Data set sizes that are very large and processing of such became capable in the 2000's.

### ML Statistical Techniques

Includes: Regression, Classifications, Clustering, etc.

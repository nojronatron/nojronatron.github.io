# React Hooks

Review React Hooks to learn what they are, and how and when to use them.

Provide links to additional references as well as code snippets where possible.

## Overview

Hooks are new in v.16.8. Most recent project I am generally working with v.18+.

Use React Features without writing a fully-blown class component.

Sharing stateful logic is difficult and often requires wrapping Components with other Components in order to get desired results.

Refactoring a working component to implement a wrapper causes code churn that React Hooks can help to avoid.

Enable "reuse [of] stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy." *[Reactjs.org API Documentation]*

Components can become complex especially when imported into React Lifecycle Methods, which makes code harder to maintain and more likely to contain bugs.

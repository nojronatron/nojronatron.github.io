# OSS Contribution Reserach: Meshtastic

## Overview

Meshtastic is software that sits in a network stack just above LoRa, a Layer 1 mesh protocol that leverages UHF, SHF bands, and ISM-banded frequencies to pass short text messages without internet or cell-tower service.

Take a look at Meshtastic OSS and see where I might be able to contribute.

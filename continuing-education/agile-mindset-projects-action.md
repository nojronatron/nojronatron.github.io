# Agile Learning Notes

## MSFT Learning - The Agile Philosophy

Emphasizes:

- Incremental delivery
- Team collaboration
- Continual planning
- Learning

Based on iterative development.

### Vertical Teams

Horizontal teams tend to have a structure similar to the project they are working on: UI, back end, etc.

Vertical teams "span the architecture and align with product outcomes".

- Members with skill sets that cover all areas to complete the feature come together as a team.
- Scaling occurs by adding teams, rather that building the organization of a single team.

### Azure Boards

Create an agile Kanban style board:

1. Create a Project
2. Create a Team
3. Add Team members
4. Create the board
5. Define a sprint
6. Assign tasks and set the iteration

### Several Processes

Agile development can be done following several processes:

- Agile: Scales well for many team and project sizes
- Scrum: Requires a Scrum Master with expertise in Scrum, and a team with Scrum training
- CMMI: For very large teams and/or projects that is much more complicated and usually overboard for smaller projects

## Microsoft Reactor Agile Mindset

Host: Sandy Liu, Certified Scrum Master

### Agile Mindset

What is Agile?

- SDLC development, integrations, etc
- Product requirements, analytics, etc
- Management such as Kanban, Scrum, etc
- Manifesto: Empowerment, collaboration, etc

### Manifesto

circa 2001

12 values and principals

This presentation will focus on the values:

- Individual and team interactions
- Working software
- Customer collaboration
- Responding to change

See the manifesto for the full context, because the values are not isolated, nor are they hard-and-fast rules.

### Mindset Values Principles Practices

Mindset:

- Developed and cultivated over time
- Just 'acting agile' is not equivalent to understanding and executing in an agile way
- Prioritizes Unity: Shared knowledge, open communication, disarmed environment
- Working solutions: Iterative, small-incremental value returns
- Customer Focus: Understand and meet needs of users
- Flexibility: Respond quickly and effectively to change and new ideas

Note: See the signatories of the Agile Manifesto for insight into who they are and what they stand for.

Values:

- People and conversations should be valued over utilizing processes and tools
- Complicated workflows are often a sign of an attempt to avoid communication and collaboration
- Celebrate new ideas and improvements from conversations lead to innovative thinking
- Focus on producing working software over comprehensive documentation
- Documentation should be focused on _executable_ units of work
- Know your customers (internal and external), check in with them for feedback loops and to build trust
- Focus on _value driven delivery_, and get them out early-on in the project

Note: Change is hard and uncomfortable, however pivoting is necessary to being able to continue delivering value. Adapting and adjusting to the environment will lead to success.

Culture: A critical component of an Agile mindset.

### Organizational Culture

Encompass values and behaviors that teams adhere to.

Develop software in better ways by:

- Doing it (yourself, as a team)
- Helping others to do it (teach and learn)

Team Effort:

- What can I learn? How can I help make things better?
- Skills, knowledge, and processes are not guaranteed to translate from team to team

Creating successful culture needs (in order of importance):

1. Psychological safety
2. Meaningful work
3. Feeling of personal impact
4. Sructure and clarity
5. Dependability of team members

There is an idea of Radical Candor _[Radical Candor, by Tim Scott]_

Radical Candor is:

- Respectful confrontation.
- Trust.
- Fundamental change.
- Challenging directly.
- Caring personally.

Common fears:

- Being truthful about bad news
- Making mistakes
- Speaking up
- Adminitting blockers
- I don't know
- Asking for help
- Questioning or challenging ideas and opinions

Lack of seeing these fears could mean a lack of innovative, collective, agile performance.

## Takeaways

Agile Framework is not about Scrum or Kenban methodologies.

Don't just go through the Agile Methodology motions.

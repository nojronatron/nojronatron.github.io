# MS Ignite Octoboer 2022

## Pre-keynote

Unprecedented times, uncertain times, technology is the way forward!

Resiliency: How you manage when bad things happen to you.

Two Clouds: Industry, and for Sustainability.

Ignite Themes:

1. Be data driven, optimize with Azure
2. Delivery efficiency with automation and AI
3. Innovate with a cloud developer platform
4. Re-energize your workforce with Microsoft 365
5. Protect everything, everyone, everywhere

## Keynote

Satya Nadella - MSFT Chairman and CEO

Orgs in industry are turning to devs and techs to be change agents through these challenging times.

Harder, longer working does not scale. Applying technology to do more work *does scale*.

Infrastructure Layer:

- Where everything starts.
- Moving to cloud allows scaling with demands.
- SQL and VM's highlighted as the best way to meet increasing demands.

Data Driven, optimize with Azure:

- Azure Arc: Build app with Azure Services, Kubernetes enabling IoT, Edge, Servers, etc.
- Ampere Ultra ARM-based processors now available in Azure.
- Premium SSD v2 Disk Storage.
- Azure Elastic SAN: Cloud-native, fully managed storage area network service.
- Azure confidential computing protects data at Rest, in Transit, while in Use. AMD, Intel, and nVidia involved. Applies to VDA, SQL, and ?
- Azure Cosmos DB supports NoSQL + Relational Data.
- MSFT Purview: Unified data governance and data security and privacy.

Deliver efficiency with automation and AI:

- Azure Machine Learning: Build, train, deploy large AI models at scale.
- Azure Container for PyTorch: Optimized Training and Inferencing engine support.
- Supported models: Turing, Z-Code, Flourence; GPT, DALL*e, Codex.

Codex demoed "pair programming" capability where a user enters a problem, and Codex correctly codes a solution. It took several tries, but Codex discovered its own bugs and fixed them.

- There was no discussion on efficiency of the algorithm in part or in whole.
- Codex was able to correctly import the Random module for use in the solution attempts.

Innovating with the Most Comprehensive Cloud Platform

- GitHub co-pilot: Finishes lines of code the dev starts, and even suggests functions for the problem at hand.
- AI Builder enhancements in Power Platform (lots listed, too rapidly to record here).
- MSFT Syntex: Content AI and process automation, including classification and annotation capabilities -- translation tool.

Re-energize the Workforce using Microsoft 365

- There is no going back to 2019!
- Three prioritization: Stop endless work paranoia; People come to the office to socialize, not for policy; Skill building and education must be a part of the investment in employees.
- Microsoft 365: Microsoft Graph underlying all MS365 products. New products added to the collection.
- Teams: Sync/Async collaboration is a requirement for performance and effectiveness. Whether together or away, both collaboration types are necessary. Building Apps for Teams has become a thing! Cisco Rooms natively supports Teams now. Mesh Avatars coming to Teams. Integration with Meta?
- New: Microsoft Places, part of the Teams family?, due in 2023.
- MSFT Viva: C-level data, CRM-data, and other info for executives? Satya hinted this will be extended to many other worker roles.
- Edge Workspaces: Shares tabs across users - multi-player web browsing.

Protect everything, and everyone, everywhere:

- Risk management becomes more difficult as the complexity of the system increases.
- Entra, Purview (compliance, data govnance); Priva, Intune, Defender, Sentinel.
- Implmentation extended to all clouds and environments.

## Build Agility, Drive Innovation With The Cloud

Scott Guthrie and Alysa Taylor

Use lowcode and nocode tools to democratize technology to as many people as possible.

Example: Reduce actual labor hours building solutions to automate some or most of that effort using lowcode/nocode tools.

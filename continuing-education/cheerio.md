# Cheerio - Server Side JQuery

Open Source Software project Cheerio looks interesting and there is an opportunity to help make it better.

Look into Cheerio, what it is, how to use it, and determine viability as an OSS contribution target.

## What It Is

Implements a subset of jQuery.

Faster than jsDOM and jQuery because it is not a full implementation.

Built-in parsers.

## Dependencies

[Parse5](https://github.com/inikulin/parse5): HTML parsing and serialization toolset for Node.js.

## Features

Short-hand JQuery.

## Discussion

Question: Can I GET a webpage, store the result in JSON, then query the JSON for what I want, then operate on that result?

Answer: Yes! See [Cheerio wiki scraper](https://github.com/nojronatron/cheerio-wiki-scraper) example project in my GitHub.

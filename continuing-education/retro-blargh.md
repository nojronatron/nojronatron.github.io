# Occasional Retrospective Notes

## Thursday 28-July-2022

Building Java Projects in GitHub using GH Actions. There is a template in github repo 'actions/starter-workflows' that is a good starter. Originally I copied an existing yml file from a CodeFellows example, but that was designed for a slightly different environment and project, so I had to modify it. There were a couple issues:

1. gradlew could not be found. This was probably because I was forcing a CHDIR in the yml file and I didn't need to.
1. gradlew could not be executed. In Linux, file permissions are managed using bits for Read, Write, eXecute, etc. Windows does as well but it is a little different. In my yml I defined an Ubuntu environment for building and testing, so permissions could be a problem. Git has the ability to set permissions via `git update-index --chmod=` and to add eXecute permissions append `+x` to the end.
1. The last change that was required was to set the JDK compatibility level to 11, instead of 17 (not supported in GH Actions?).

Earlier today was a Code 401 instructor's panel where they discussed current content in those classes. There was a good amount of discussion around C#/DotNet, and TypeScript (which is starting to make inroads to the JS class due to increased use in the industry). There was also good discussion around strategies to deal with learning to code, especially JS, such as breaking down the problem in words, and writing solutions as comments rather than code, and then worry about coding the problem once an algorithm appears to solve the problem at hand.

Today I passed the final technical interview at Code Fellows and am officially an alum! Certificate is due in a week or so!

Passing the technical interview was extremely difficult, and I followed the advice I'd received from Code Fellows instructors and staff: Stick with it, pay attention to the details, break down a problem into the smallest parts, and take care of myself along the way. I will continue to do more technical interview practicing while I job hunt, so that I am well practiced and can more easily get over nervousness during a real interview.

Today I picked-up where I left off with one of my older projects, the [Bigfoot Bib Report WL Form](https://nojronatron.github.io/Bigfoot-Bib-Report-WL-Form/). The BigFoot 200 event is coming up and during a recent preparatory meeting the form was re-introduced (much to my surprise and delight) and there was new (and renewed) interest in it. I'm going to try and get this as ready as possible, with help from other interested volunteers to test it and provide feedback on possible improvements.

There are a ton of projects on my pet-project kanban board that I stil need to get to. There is definitely more work than there is time. At least these projects and tasks are centered around the goals of improving my software developer skills in every regard, and prepare me for my next big thing.

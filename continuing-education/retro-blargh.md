# Occasional Retrospective Notes

## Saturday 20-Aug-2022

Despite telling myself I wouldn't do much "techie" stuff today, here I am working through CSSBattles.

Battle #2, Eye Of The Tiger #16 is pretty great. I couldn't finish it in 10 minutes like [these guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ya4wpDgy_o) but that's not really important. The key take-aways are:

1. When using `display: flex;` always try `margin: auto;` in the child box to center it easily
1. Creating circular-ish items (think eyelid, teardrop, etc) use `border-radius: {top-left} {top-right} {bottom-right} {bottom-left}` in that order to control each corner
1. Margin properties are collapsed into a single line similar to border and border-radius: `margin: {top} {right} {bottom} {left}`
1. Rotating a box with `transform: rotate(ndeg);` will make your margin-adjusting efforts confusing - just remember the previous take-away (tilt your head)

Over the past 2 weeks I have been busy with preparing for, and participating in, volunteer activities. The Multiple Sclorosis NW Division holds fund-raising bike rides throughout the US, and I helped by providing amateur radio and transportation services to promote a successful, incident-free, and enjoyable event for all participants and the MS Society itself. Less than a week later, I travelled into the woods to support Destination Trail's "Bigfoot 200" ultra-trail-marathon through the Gifford-Pinchot National Forest. Again, I provided ham radio communications to support the success of this event in terms of tracking runner's bib numbers as they enter and leave aid stations, as well as ones that "drop out" of the race due to time cutoff or exhaustion. Logistics is another big part of my volunteer efforts in person as well as "on the air" using ham radio, to help arrange supply deliveries, transportation of runners and crew from an Aid Station to another location, etc.

CodeWars challenges are a great way to prepare for technical interviews, especially wnen using a whiteboard to rationally work through the problem and design a possible solution. Practicing javascript challenges will help prepare me for anticipated work in the EnigmaBay team, on the Lingo Bingo WebApp.

Fridays at Code Fellows tend to be busy with streams of final presentations, mid-term presentations, guest speakers, and collective social events for CF students and alumni. Today's JavaScript 401 Finals presentations included a team with Andrew S, whom I hadn't talk to in a while. He was a peer in previous CF classes with me, and it was great to see him present his team's project. All teams presented very well and it was great to see their progress toward graduation!

There was also a Python Midterm presentation. The first team included previous team-mate Liesl, and the team obviously had a *lot* of fun presenting their app. The next team included previous team-mate Dana H and Gina N, as well as co-Code Fellows team mate Vinny S! Their app searches Wikipedia and finds related articles that link together a "start" and "end" article. The other teams also had amazing projects including a Chess game built from the ground up that included a console version as well as a GUI, and an app that scaped Canvas data and provided graphs, calendaring items, and quick links to common tools and areas of Canvas.

Back into coding practice, I work on CSSBattle.dev again. I need to remember how to make trangles, so here is an example of an upright isocolese triangle in red:

1. Set the left border as 100px solid and *transparent*
1. Set the right border as 100px solid and *tranparent*
1. Set the top border as 100px solid and red (or your preferred color for the entire triangle)

It is important to remember that the vertex angle is determined by border-left and border-right unit settings.

At some point in the future, I'll want to change-up this format to something like a more formal blog article. I haven't decided yet what it will be, other than not a massively long MD file with a FILO stack of entries.

I finished up the Zip Linked Lists code challenge review by performing a mock whiteboard interview within a 45 minute period and then adding the whiteboard to the solution. This is not really sustainable in that it will cause a tremendous number of repositories to appear in my GH profile with little benefit (to anyone), so I plan to set up separate code challenge repositories for various languages.

Related, I worked my way through a CodeWars challenge in javascript (which I haven't written much of lately). I followed the general rubrik outlined by Code Fellows for a technical interview and produced reasonable code that passed the default CodeWars unit tests. Not that that is everything! So this prompted me to create a new js-specific code challenge repository, so this a future efforts will have a place to live.

Somehow I decided today was a good day to look up how to add emojis to markdown files. There are at least two ways:

- If supported, just use colon-surrounding syntax i.e. `:smile:`
- Point to the appropriate API using image placeholder syntax i.e. `![smiley](url-to-smiley-emoji)`

For example:

`:smile:` in supported markdown interpreters results in a :smile:

`!["smiley"](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f603.png?v8)` results in a vvv large smiley vvv

!["smiley"](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f603.png?v8)

Building Java Projects in GitHub using GH Actions. There is a template in github repo 'actions/starter-workflows' that is a good starter. Originally I copied an existing yml file from a CodeFellows example, but that was designed for a slightly different environment and project, so I had to modify it. There were a couple issues:

1. gradlew could not be found. This was probably because I was forcing a CHDIR in the yml file and I didn't need to.
1. gradlew could not be executed. In Linux, file permissions are managed using bits for Read, Write, eXecute, etc. Windows does as well but it is a little different. In my yml I defined an Ubuntu environment for building and testing, so permissions could be a problem. Git has the ability to set permissions via `git update-index --chmod=` and to add eXecute permissions append `+x` to the end.
1. The last change that was required was to set the JDK compatibility level to 11, instead of 17 (not supported in GH Actions?).

Earlier today was a Code 401 instructor's panel where they discussed current content in those classes. There was a good amount of discussion around C#/DotNet, and TypeScript (which is starting to make inroads to the JS class due to increased use in the industry). There was also good discussion around strategies to deal with learning to code, especially JS, such as breaking down the problem in words, and writing solutions as comments rather than code, and then worry about coding the problem once an algorithm appears to solve the problem at hand.

## Wednesday 27-July-2022

Today I passed the final technical interview at Code Fellows and am officially an alum! Certificate is due in a week or so!

Passing the technical interview was extremely difficult, and I followed the advice I'd received from Code Fellows instructors and staff: Stick with it, pay attention to the details, break down a problem into the smallest parts, and take care of myself along the way. I will continue to do more technical interview practicing while I job hunt, so that I am well practiced and can more easily get over nervousness during a real interview.

Today I picked-up where I left off with one of my older projects, the [Bigfoot Bib Report WL Form](https://nojronatron.github.io/Bigfoot-Bib-Report-WL-Form/). The BigFoot 200 event is coming up and during a recent preparatory meeting the form was re-introduced (much to my surprise and delight) and there was new (and renewed) interest in it. I'm going to try and get this as ready as possible, with help from other interested volunteers to test it and provide feedback on possible improvements.

There are a ton of projects on my pet-project kanban board that I stil need to get to. There is definitely more work than there is time. At least these projects and tasks are centered around the goals of improving my software developer skills in every regard, and prepare me for my next big thing.

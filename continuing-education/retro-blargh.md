# Occasional Retrospective Notes

## Wednesday 27-July-2022

Today I passed the final technical interview at Code Fellows and am officially an alum! Certificate is due in a week or so!

Passing the technical interview was extremely difficult, and I followed the advice I'd received from Code Fellows instructors and staff: Stick with it, pay attention to the details, break down a problem into the smallest parts, and take care of myself along the way. I will continue to do more technical interview practicing while I job hunt, so that I am well practiced and can more easily get over nervousness during a real interview.

Today I picked-up where I left off with one of my older projects, the [Bigfoot Bib Report WL Form](https://nojronatron.github.io/Bigfoot-Bib-Report-WL-Form/). The BigFoot 200 event is coming up and during a recent preparatory meeting the form was re-introduced (much to my surprise and delight) and there was new (and renewed) interest in it. I'm going to try and get this as ready as possible, with help from other interested volunteers to test it and provide feedback on possible improvements.

There are a ton of projects on my pet-project kanban board that I stil need to get to. There is definitely more work than there is time. At least these projects and tasks are centered around the goals of improving my software developer skills in every regard, and prepare me for my next big thing.

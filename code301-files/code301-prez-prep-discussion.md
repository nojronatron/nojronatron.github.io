Elevated dress code: Business casual, unless specific to the context/teme of the app.  
No eating or drinking on camera.  
Avoid filler-speech -- polish what you are saying to avoid these.

Avoid distracting backgrounds, maybe pick a Zoom background to use.  
Select 1 person to run slides AND app demo, to quickly flip between two screens.  
Turn off notifications!

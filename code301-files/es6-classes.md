# ES 6 Classes Lecture Notes

## Data Modeling

Use constructor functions and prototypes to model data.  
ES6 Classes will help.  

### Classes

Classes have attributes and behaviors.  

- Attributes describe what something *is*.  
- Behaviors describe what something *does* or *can do*.  

### Syntax and Use

ES6 sytax and best practices for creating objects and clases:

- Use `const` to define a Constructor Function.  
- Use Pascal case to name Classes and Constructor Functions.  
- Prototype Function names are all lower-case.  
- Prototype Functions allows adding new Attributes and Behaviors to an existing instance.  
- Properties can be set by invokation of methods on an instance of a Class.  
- By adding a Constructor Class Method, a lot of memory is used. Instead, use Prototype Functions.  
- By adding a Prototype Function, it is not stored *with* the Class or Constructor Method instance, saving memory. Rather, it is just associated with every instance of the class.

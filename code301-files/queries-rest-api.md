### Tidbits and Takeaways

A few tidbits that spoke to me while skimming the article (having read it last month).  

"In Silicon Valley, software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems." *[NYTimes, 28-Feb-2016, accesed 19-Apr-2022]*  

"Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction." *[NYTimes, 28-Feb-2016, accessed 19-Apr-2022]*

"In a 2015 study, executives said that profitability increases when workers are persuaded to collaborate more." *[NYTimes, 28-Feb-2016, accessed 19-Apr-2022]*

### Q and A about REST

Who is Roy Fielding?

> An originator of the HTTP protocol and the the designer of the REST specification.  

Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?  

> The primary goal(s) of apps early on in the world wide web only needed to talk to small groups of other computers, not all of them.  

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?  

> It is designed to arrange VERBS and NOUNS in a way that allow computers to talk to each other in a common language.  

What does a GET do?  

> It tells the target computer to retreive and return something to the asking computer.  

What does a POST do?  

> It tells the target computer to add something/data, as defined by the asking computer.  

What does PUT do?  

> Like POST, but is a *replace* operation rather than an add.  

What does PATCH do?  

> List a PUT, but is a *partial* replacement of an existing piece of information.

## Chapter 16: Images

Keep your HTML markup clean by using CSS to control the placement, style, and orientation of images on the website.  


### Controlling Image Size using CSS

The `width` or `height` properties in CSS control image size and help the browser to load the page more efficiently.  
Use CSS classes names "small", "medium", and "large" to pre-determine 3 common image sizes for the site and apply those classes in the HTML markup.

## Chapter 9: Flash

Althouht an older, deprecated technology, Flash had a large impact on the internet, then and now.  
Authoring Flash content usually required software licensed from Adobe - some other unlicensed tools were available.  
HTML tags `<object>` and `<embed>` were used to add Flash to websites but later JavaScript was used instead.  
Flash `.fla` files were run within a browser using the Flash Player plugin.  
Initially, Flash was used for small animations, but it grew into a tool for creating fully functional websites.  
HTML5 introduced `<audio>` and `<video>` tags, which are used now.  

### Hosting vs Plugins vs HTML5

A web server can host video files in various formats for HTML5 websites to consume.  
Generally it is easier to host video on a service like Vimeo or YouTube.  
Requiring a Plug-in to use certain features of your website could reduce the number of potential site viewers.  
Using a hosting service also simplifies transcoding...it is done for you.

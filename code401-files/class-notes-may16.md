A collection of draft, WIP, and straggler notes taken during class discussion, presentations, etc.  

## Dr.Robin

You Are A Software Developer! Get used to calling yourself this.  
We are all developers here, and the more often you say it the more of a reality it becomes.  
"Tech skills for a better life, community, and world." -Code Fellows Vision  
Mission: Guide people from all backgrounds to change lives through fast-paced, career-focused education. Shaping passionate learners with immersive training to meet industry needs and improve diversity." -Code Fellows Mission  

Campus Director

### Advice

- Use "___ helped with ___" to ensure assistants are recognized.  
- Attribute with URLs to copied code.  
- Include collaborative efforts in Readme.md or Collab.md  
- The more you put in, the more you will get out.  
- Set up a schedule and *stick to it*, including breaks, food, and drink.  
- Ask for help, do NOT 'muscle through' issues.  
- Dig-in to networking during Code 401 (it is expected)  
- Polish materials to get ready for interviews including "do my GitHub Projects showcase my talent?"  
- Personal Brand: 'Here I am, someone who is invested in *some thing*' and preparing to *promote your brand*... things that set you apart from the rest of the field. Culminates in Brand Presentation day.  

### Career Accelerator Program

Direct support to you while planning for your next career.  
Must graduate 401, submit a (stellar) resume, pass a qualifying *moch behavioral* interview (45 mins max) with post-interview feedback for improvement. DO NOT LEAVE THIS ON THE TABLE.  
Not a one-shot deal.  

### Talent Portal

Connects alumni with 'partners' with Code Fellows, where CF manages resume passing and keeping alumni notified as to which partner(s) are viewing the CAP resume.  

## Class Discussion

Prepare for reading a ton of documentation.  
Start getting good at extrapolating a solution from reading documentation and other resources.  
Put effort into *exposure* and *practice* throughout this class, and within tech.  
Slack DM Alex for short discussions or anything that is critically important.  
For longer discussions (30 mins+) schedule ahead of time w/ Alex.  
Lunch will *always* be from 1230 to 1330.  
Get code challenges out of the way 1st and DO NOT TAKE LONGER else you are doing yourself a dis-service.  
You have *one job* as a developer: SOLVE PROBLEMS, which can be an *endless time suck*.  
Do *not* refactor until you are done *solving the problem*.  
Goto Canvas and the Class Repo to keep up to date and help solving code problems, including class recordings (1-3 hrs after class to encode).  
FYI: React can work with other languages besides javascript.  
Spring MVC:  
Thymeleaf: Template engine.  
Assignments will re-open before mid-terms, then close for the remainder of the class.  
Final opportunity to submit assignments during 2nd half will be before final project week.  
Late work: Turn-in substantially completed work *before* deadlines, to avoid penalty when completed later.  
Do NOT worry about implementing tests in Code Challenge Day 1.  
While Alex is in Remo, he is available to get assistance/conversations.

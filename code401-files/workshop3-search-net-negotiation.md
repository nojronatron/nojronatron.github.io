# The Job Search, Networking, and Negotiations

Dr.Robin hosts!  

## Plan

Two weeks before Moch Interviews.  
Three weeks until Technical Interviews.  

## Job Descriptions

What is up with "junior level position with 10 years experience..."?  

1. Team needs a hole filled, goes to their manager
1. Manager goes up the chain to get approval to increase head count
1. Up the chain gets a Recruiter involved
1. Recruiter pulls strings to post new position, but has to go back to get Q's answered re: requirements
1. At this point some disjointed asks come back and disjointed responses
1. Position is posted with "boilerplate" text and requirements

Even though they do not match the actual position requirements, that is what goes public.  
During the phone screening and in-person interviews, you will learn the actual requirements.  
Regardless, if many of "your boxes are checked" then throw-in your resume.  
ATS or Recruiter will throw-out anything that doesn't meet their standards, otherwise you will learn more about the open position.  

## High Volume vs Targeted Searches

### High Volume

High volume is most common application standard.  
Investment is low, simple applications proceses usually an automated system, etc.  
Only 1-2% of these types of searches yield an interview.  
There are so many "job boards" that high-volume is what most job seekers do.  
Employers pay for these job posting board publishings.  
There will be 100's if not thousands of people applying for these positions.  
No cover letter needed, although those that *do* ask for one will have specific requirements so be sure to follow it exactly.  

#### Application Tracking System

ATS => Designed to *eliminate* resumes that do not meet specified requirements.  
Recruiters then filter-out more.  
So 500 applications => 200 post ATS => 40 accepted by Recruiter => 3-6 selected for phone inteviews => 2-4 for interview.  
Use Boolean search strings: AND, OR, and NOT.  
Remote, in-office, or hybrid?  
What title am I looking for?  
Am I looking for a specific company?  
2-7 and 8-15 day range is good enough; 30+ days you should consider job is filled.  

### Targeted

Create an account with a company you are stalking! Follow them on social media, etc.  
Be strategic.  
Spend time learning about mission, vision, products, etc.  
Find out what the company culture is like.  

### Cover Letter

Follow instructions to the tee.  
Show that you can communicate and write.  

#### Add Value Proposition

Offer details feature suggestion.  
find/describe a bug in thei product or wesite.  
check for bug bounty programs like hackerone.  
Make PR to their public Github repo.  
Find a syntax error on their website.  
Write a conde that illustrates a suggested change or fix.  

## Networking

In the Tech community, people are willing to invest in other's success.  
Networking has a bad reputation though: Networking events w/ no real connection; networking creates shallow connections.  
Trditionally people believe networking must be a fully-fledged relationship - it doesn't.  
Hiring managers say "...do you know anybody who would be good for this position?"  

Networking is NOT:

- A sales pitch.
- Collecting business cards, phone numbers, etc.
- Being disingenuous.
- Dismissing people.
- Taking without giving!
- Happening under only a single circumstance!

Remember:

- You have experiences and ideas and things to offer and share.
- Build relationships though learning about them and finding ways to connect.  

At Networking Events:

- Start before you need it  => find people in your immediate viscinity.
- Start with an existing base.
- Take on a Host or Greeter role.
- Have different pitches ready.
- Try "how can I help" approach.
- Learn the art of small talk: Questions, common ground, reveal something, find passions
- Linked-in with others where you find common interests.
- Follow-up, then follow-up on your follow-up!

## Best Practices

ATS: Keywords, formatting, phrases.  
Be AVAILABLE!  
Buid and maintain a connection with a company/employees.  
Discover how to make the hiring manager's job easier!
Subscribe to newsletters, blogs, and news alerts.  
Write and review cover letters.  
Don't worry if there isn't a specific job posting, there is evidence

## Resources

Better Business Bureau => Avoid scams, verify companies standing, etc.  

## TODOs

[ ] Define what my *idea position* looks like, write it down, edit as it evolves.  
[ ] Revisit Linkedin Job Search and use the Boolean Filters (2-3 saved searches, only 1 filtering exp level).

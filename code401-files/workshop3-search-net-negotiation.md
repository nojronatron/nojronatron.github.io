# The Job Search, Networking, and Negotiations

Dr.Robin hosts!  

## Plan

Two weeks before Moch Interviews.  
Three weeks until Technical Interviews.  

## Job Descriptions

What is up with "junior level position with 10 years experience..."?  

1. Team needs a hole filled, goes to their manager
1. Manager goes up the chain to get approval to increase head count
1. Up the chain gets a Recruiter involved
1. Recruiter pulls strings to post new position, but has to go back to get Q's answered re: requirements
1. At this point some disjointed asks come back and disjointed responses
1. Position is posted with "boilerplate" text and requirements

Even though they do not match the actual position requirements, that is what goes public.  
During the phone screening and in-person interviews, you will learn the actual requirements.  
Regardless, if many of "your boxes are checked" then throw-in your resume.  
ATS or Recruiter will throw-out anything that doesn't meet their standards, otherwise you will learn more about the open position.  

## High Volume vs Targeted Searches

### High Volume

High volume is most common application standard.  
Investment is low, simple applications proceses usually an automated system, etc.  
Only 1-2% of these types of searches yield an interview.  
There are so many "job boards" that high-volume is what most job seekers do.  
Employers pay for these job posting board publishings.  
There will be 100's if not thousands of people applying for these positions.  

#### Application Tracking System

ATS => Designed to *eliminate* resumes that do not meet specified requirements.  
Recruiters then filter-out more.  
So 500 applications => 200 post ATS => 40 accepted by Recruiter => 3-6 selected for phone inteviews => 2-4 for interview.  

### Targeted

Use Boolean search strings: AND, OR, and NOT.

## Deliberate Practice

Skills improvement comes with experience and practice.  
Knowledge expansion comes with testing and trials, not by accident.  
Build multiple apps, one after another, through *deliberate practice*.  
Ask myself whether what I am doing pushes me outside of my comfort zone.  

> If I am still operating within my comfort zone, am I really learning?
> If I am writing the same programs I wrote 3 months ago, or a year or more ago, but with a different name, am I just 'playing through a song'?

Expert musicians don't just play through their songs in entirety and hope to get better, they practice the hard stuff again and again in order to improve.  

## Advice Gleaned From Reading

- Do not rely on your day job to challenge you in the right ways that promote learning.  
- Feedback on efforts is usually immediate (in the coding world) so use that as rapid learning opportunities.  
- Embrace the difficulty, and avoid becoming frustrated (slows or blocks learning).  
- Challenge yourself with tasks that once achieved, you've learned something new.  

## Challening Yourself

[ ] What do you want to learn next?  
[ ] What would be cool/fun to learn but been to afraid to try?  
[ ] Pick a small, finishable challenge *away* from your current focus to pull you out of your comfort zone and into new realms of learning and experience.

## Robins Workshop

- With all of our skills so far, we still need to be able to communicate with others to share our skillsets and basically pitch ourselves.
- "I am going to do the job you offer me in such a way that it will showcase my skills and capabilities."  

## Resumes

Really important to the process.

## Go To Market Strategy

- Networking is the most important factor.
- Giving yourself permission to be in the space.
- Once people know who you are and what you are about, those relationships will help with your career.
- We all come to the table with different experiences.
- Sometimes hiring organizations don't really know who/what they are looking for beyond a title perhaps, but there is a question that continues "what is it that is going to make my team excel and allow us to continue to be relevant in the market space?"  
- Showing energy and the right amount of confidence, with a good mix of willingness to try and evidence of failing as a right of passage but not a distraction or end of the journey.

## Unique Value Proposition

- YOU ARE the unique value prop to potential employers.
- Use that as a means to sell your ability - whatever level you are at.

## Seven Steps

From graduation to employment:

1. Graduate from 401 - Enter the Career Accelerator program requirement  
2. Look for work - Have "job search stamina"  
3. Have a stellar resume - also a Career Accelerator Program entry requirement  
4. Technical Interview - in person/online or as take-home to share your logic and thinking process  
5. Meet the Team interview - Behavioral Questions, find out about org, team, structure, and culture: Are we a good fit for each other?  
6. Offer
7. This is an opportunity to negotiate, which _should be done_ e.g. $90k? How about $110k?  

## Unlocking the Seven Steps

- Build personal brand.
- Build Resume.
- Include volunteerism and non-technical info.
- Decide where you are going.
- List tools, frameworks, and languages.
- Networking.
- Translating skills.
- Think like a recruiter.

### Personal Brand  

- Leave breadcrumbs in your social media as to who you are.
- Separate your personal from professional presentations in online interactions and branding.
- Make your professional presentation appear to be "evolving" and not static.
- Ensure your Personal Brand shows who you are connected to.
- Share information (with a level of excitement) with others!  

### Resume

- Showcase solid projects!  
- Free of spelling errors.
- Grammar is critical: Succinctly describe what you have done and where you are going, all in complete sentances of complete thoughts.
- Consider your Resume as _more than a work-record_. It is a showcase, promoting skills and tools that support your unique value proposition to viewers.
- Include coding languages used.
- Include Tools and Frameworks used.
- Include completed projects.
- Declare what can I do for the company that I am looking to get hired by?  
- If a company your are targeting is using terminology that applies to you, but your Resume doesn't have the same terminology, ADD THAT TERMINOLOGY to your resume before submitting it.
- Limit to less than 2 pages: Condense information and be concise; Widen margins; make tough decisions on _what actually needs to be on the page_.
- Limit history to 10 years.

### Volunteerism and Non-technical Info

- List under Experience (i.e. work experience).
- Keep it out of the technical interview.
- Ask yourself: What leverage is this going to give me?  

### Where Are You Going

Profile Statement: Where are you going? Be brief, less than 4 sentences.

- Include anything that is particular such as secret clearance.
- Include what I am passionate about.

### Tools and Languages

List all the tools you've used! You do not have to be an expert in the tool in order to list it!! Sometimes you'll need to _review_ tools, but do not leave it off unless you are unable to talk about it.

- Put Tools in order of comfort, knowledge, and proficiency.
- ALWAYS PUT FIRST the languages and tools you WANT TO USE IN YOUR JOB.

### Networking

- Have a genuine conversation with others to help build your network.
- Artificial "networking events" can be challenging and not always effective.

### Translating Your Skills

- Use _action verbs_.
- Include _quantifiable_ phrases. How many team members? How many clients? etc.
- Add numbers and dollar-signs and percentages of the impacts.
- What impact did your efforts have? ...On your team? On your group? On your company? On the bottom line? What were the effects?

## Think Like a Recruiter

- Imagine being the recruiter while writing the resume.
- Consider how you, as a recruiter, view your projects and online presence.

# Coaching Conversation Workshop - Resumes

## Robins Workshop

With all of our skills so far, we still need to be able to communicate with others to share our skillsets and basically pitch ourselves.  
"I am going to do the job you offer me in such a way that it will showcase my skills and capabilities."  

### Resumes

Really important to the process.  

### GTM Strategy

Go To Market Strategy.  
Networking is the most important factor.  
Giving yourself permission to be in the space.  
Once people know who you are and what you are about, those relationships will help with your career.  
We all come to the table with different experiences that we can bring to the table.  
Sometimes hiring organizations don't really know who/what they are looking for beyond a title perhaps, but there is a question that continues "what is it that is going to make my team excel and allow us to continue to be relevant in the market space."  
Showing energy and the right amount of confidence, with a good mix of willingness to try and evidence of failing as a right of passage but not a distraction or end of the journey.  

#### Unique Value Proposition

YOU ARE the unique value prop to potential employers.  
Maintain the idea that you ARE the value prop and use that as a means to sell your ability - whatever level you are at.  

## Seven Steps

From graduation to employment:

1. Graduate from 401 - Enter the Career Accelerator program requirement  
2. Look for work - Have "job search stamina"  
3. Have a stellar resume - also a Career Accelerator Program entry requirement  
4. Technical Interview - in person/online or as take-home to share your logic and thinking process  
5. Meet the Team interview - Behavioral Questions, find out about org, team, structure, and culture: Are we a good fit for each other?  
6. Offer
7. This is an opportunity to negotiate, which *should be done* e.g. $90k? How about $110k?  

## Unlocking the Seven Steps

Build your GTM Strategy:

### Personal Brand  

Leave breadcrumbs in your social media as to who you are.  
Separate your online brands' personal from professional presentations.  
Make your professional presentation appear to be "evolving" and not static.  
Ensure your Personal Brand shows who you are connected to.  
Share information (with a level of excitement) with others!  
During Code Fellows is the time to build this!  

### Resume

Showcase solid projects!  
Free of spelling errors.  
Grammar is critical: Succinctly describe what you have done and where you are going, all in complete sentances of complete thoughts.  
Consider your Resume as *more* than a work-record, and more like a showcase, promotion of your skills and tools that support your unique value proposition to viewers.  
Languages used.  
Tools used.  
Projects completed.  
What can I do for the company that I am looking to get hired by?  
If a company your are targeting is using terminology that applies to you, but your Resume doesn't have the same terminology, ADD THAT TERMINOLOGY to your resume before submitting it.  
Limit to less than 2 pages: Condense information and be concise; Widen margins; make tough dicisions on what actually *needs* to be on the page.  
Limit history to 10 years.  
Code Fellows has 3 templated resumes with slightly different format/layouts, however they *still follow the guidance on content and effectiveness*  

### Volunteerism and Non-technical Info

List under Experience (i.e. work experience).  
Keep it out of the technical interview.  
As yourself: What leverage is this going to give me?  

#### Where Are You Going

Profile Statement: Where are you going? Be brief, less than 4 sentances.  

- Include anything that is particular such as secret clearance.  
- Include what I am passionate about.  

#### Tools and Languages

List all the tools you've used! You do not have to be an expert in the tool in order to list it!! Sometimes you'll need to *review* tools, but do not leave it off unless you are unable to talk about it.

Put Tools in order of comfort, knowledge, and proficiency.  

ALWAYS PUT FIRST the languages and tools you WANT TO USE IN YOUR JOB.  

### Networking

Have a genuine conversation with others to help build your network.  
Artificial "networking events" can be challenging and not always effective (Robin described these as dreadful and mentioned the effect of a pandemic removing these is a good thing).  

### Translating Your Skills

Use *action verbs*.  
Include *quantifiable* phrases.  
Add numbers and dollar-signs and percentages of the impacts.  
How many? When working with others or groups or organizations, how many did you work with?  
What impact did your efforts have on your team? Your group? Your company? The bottom line? Effectiveness?

## First Timers Only

Scott Hanselman and Kent Dodds put together this website (and efforts behind promoting the OSS community). Links to resources for how to get starting contributing to OSS projects, as well as tips for OSS project owners to make their projects easier to find and work with especially for new contributors.

There are multiple links to OSS contributing resources and tips, as well as a link to a GitHub APP that will make "good first issue" markers easier to apply.

## Motivations To Contribute to OSS

> A great way to practice coding, everyday!

> Learn by working on a live codebase.

> Gain valuable feedback on your code and development processes.

> More experienced developers can concentrate on more difficult or complex issues, leaving simpler issues for less experienced devs.

> Some companies require OSS participation as a gating factor to employment.

> Gain experience reading and writing code, and finding bugs.

> Peer recognition: Builds professional network and provides a means for others to see and understand a developer's skill level and passion for software development.

> Prospective employers can easily skim OSS code in public repositories and gain insight into a candidate's activities, interests, and capabilities -- their potential value-add.

> Even non-code oriented contributions are encouraged with OSS. For example: Feature suggestions, finding bugs, and updating or improving documentation.

# Reference Materials

## Unit Tests

Clean, reusable, abstract components should be [tested](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Challenge_Testing)

## README

Clear, consise, helpful [documentation](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Challenge_Documentation) of your code for your followers, users, and partners.

## Whiteboard Challenges

Follow the CF designated [workflow](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Whiteboard_Workflow.html)

1. Problem Domain => Visualize the input and output and ask questions to discover what the question actually is.
1. Visualization => Visually solve the problem, use labels and define input and output.
1. Algorithm => Breakdown of what needs to be done in bulleted list or overview plan form.
1. Big O (Time and Space) => Mention this at times throughout interview and how it applies to your design, then complete it once pseudo/coded.
1. Pseudo or Code (preferred language) => Define the algorithm using [pseudocode](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Pseudocode)
1. Test Cases => Given n, m, x, return y. At any time throughout the process, test cases and *testing approach* should be discussed.
1. Step Through => Track variables in a table while walking line-by-line through the code.
1. Verify your work => Missing anything? Code tidy-up required? Visualization tidy and legible? Make good use of remaining time.

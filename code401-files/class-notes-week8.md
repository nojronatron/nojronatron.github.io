# Week Eight Discussions Log

## Tuesday 5-July

Monday was a holiday.

What full-stack things we've done in class so far:

- PostgresQL
- Spring Framework
- JPA
- Room
- AWS Amplify and DynamoDB

### Tech Interview Scoring Advice

Technical Interview scoring:

Interpreting the Question:

- Asking questions: Get free points by asking null, how many, already sorted, in-place or new questions.
- Question: If you are not told what to return, ask what needs to be returned, including type of structure.
- ID I/O: "Input is n, Output is n" and *must* be visually depicted on the whiteboard.
- Illustrate the problem domain: What is actually happening? What is going on and what is happening to the tree?
- ID Optimal Datastructure: This is usually discovered while asking questions and determining the input and output. What is the parent-child relationship in the data? Knowing this will help.

Solved the Technical Problem:

- You *must have finished code* to get points.
- You *must have a complete algorithm* to get points.
- Solution was the best possible? Full 2 pts for using the correct datastructure, but any solution should get you a single point.

Analyse the Proposed Solution:

- Step through the solution. Tell the interviewer what your code/algorithm is doing.
- Reason your way through BigO, but points could be up to the interviewer.
- Explain an approach to testing: Nothing will net zero points. JUnit, Espresso, null-testing, edge-value cases, and arrange-act-assert method.

Communicated Effectively Throughout:

- Verbalize the thought process.
- Use correct terminology: Traverse a datastructure. Iterate or Recurse a looping structure.
- Use time effectively: Get to writing the algorithm and the code as quickly as possible to get this full point.
- Over/underconfidence: Be confident despite not knowing what is going on. Alternatively, don't be over-confident if you *do* know what is going on.
- Readability of whiteboard: If it is difficult to separate different sections/boxed-in/illegible, clean it up for a free point.

## TODOs

- [ ] Practice traversing data structures to prep for interviews.

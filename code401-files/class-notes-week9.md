## Going Forward

Finals Week team reviews due Sunday following final presentations.

Review the core Java knowledge like:

- Name the 7 primitives.
- Object inheritance and polymorphism.
- Interfaces and abstractions.

## Tuesday 12 July

Tuesday is last day of code content.

Tuesday will be GooglePlay Location.

### S3 Review

Add Image Button => Image Picking Activity.

Convert to an input stream and publish to S3.

Geocoding: Referencing a place by it's name or street address, and translating that to geographical coordinates.

There are privacy concerns, both PII and App, Phone security implications.

### Final Project Prep

Teams need to work on project ideas and prepare, as a team, to pitch up to 2 ideas to Alex.

Teams need to agree on what they want to do before pitching it.

### Domain Modeling

It is in *everything*.

Relationships exist in databases, but also just about everything else!

### Lab - Location

GooglePlay Services: Location Provider Client - is a newer thing. The older service required the App to manage the connection to Google API Client service.

SocketIO

- Open sockets to communicate with another server.
- Logic exists to handle interruptions, but is essentially an open, tethered internet connection.
- Resulted in lots of callbacks in App implementation.

New:

- In onCreate lifecycle, implement FusedLocationProviderClient.
- LocationServices.getFusedLocationProviderClient enables requesting various types of location updates.

Last Location:

- Minimal battery usage.
- No active network connection.

Current Location:

- Much more battery usage.
- Active network connection.

Request Location Updates:

- Enables regular updates when the Device is moving.

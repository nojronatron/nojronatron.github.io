# The Power Of Believing You Can Improve

Speaker: Carol Dweck discusses the growth mindset.

## Notes

Students challenged with "a little too hard" problems.

Some responded:  

- I love a challenge
- I was hoping this would be informative

Others responded:  

- Catestrophic failures due to intelligence being judged
- Cheat vs Study
- Find someone worse
- Run from difficulty

## Science

Fixed mind-set students run from an error and their brain activity is low.  
Growth mind-set students had much greater brain activity!  

> Abilities can be *developed*.

Process, Learn, and Correct: Using these steps help students learn and move forward.  
Praise the *process* the student engages in.  
Effort, Strategy, and Process: Reward process instead of 'right' or 'first' or 'most'.  
The word 'yet' promotes considering learning into the future, rather than an end and binary success vs failure.  

## Equality

There are chronic under-performers like kids in inner-cities or on american reservations.  
However growth mind-set teaching makes a difference (National Achievement Tests provide supporting data).

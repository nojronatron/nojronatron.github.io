# Class Notes Week 2

31-May through 3-June 2022

## Tuesday Discussion

For the next 2 weeks: Working on building servers in Java.  
Lots of assignments / calendar will be shifted around a bit due to Memorial Day.  
Using URL Params to make sites reactive.  
Personal Pitches:

- Okay to rework it as needed!
- Bullet points is a good way to go
- Might be *less than 15 seconds* to make a good impression on somebody

## The Rule of Three

"Three Strikes and Refactor!"  
When developing code, the 3rd time that similar code is written, it should be a candidate for code within a helper function.  
On the flip-side, refactoring code *to early* can cause more code problems in the future when requirements change or are added.  
Two instances of similar code is probably fine, three instances is time to reconsider, more than 3 => a refactoring plan should be put in place.  

## You Aren't Gonna Need It

Saying arose from Extreme Programming (XP).  
Basically *do not add functionality until it is absolutely necessary*.  
"Do the simplest thing that could possibly work".

# The Power of Passion and Perseverance

A Ted Talks Education talk discussion with [Angela Lee Duckworth](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance)  

## IQ Is Not The Difference

Who is successful in school and why?  
A predictor of success came down to *grit*.  
Grit is passion and perseverence for long-term goals.  
Live life as if it were a marathon, not a sprint.  

## How Is Grit Built?

Talent doesn't *make* you 'grittier'.  
Grit is sometimes inversely related to intelligence.  
Growth-mindset is related to grit and success.  
In the growth-mindset, failure is a passing state and not an end-result, therefore contributing to perseverence.  

## Be Wrong

Take best ideas and measure success.  
Must be willing to fail and be wrong.  
Be willing to start over with lessons learned.

## About Java Packages

Java Packages are containers with types (classes and interfaces and so-on) that are easily maintainable and can be utilized by other code.  
Java *Projects* allow only one Class Name type per project.  
Packages are named using qualified naming schemes to help separate similarly (or same) named classes, for example:  

```java
import java.util.Date;
import java.sql.Date;
```

The above are 2 different classes.  

### Two Categories of Packages

Built-in: Packaged with a JDK.  
User-defined: Packages users create following a set of rules and principals.

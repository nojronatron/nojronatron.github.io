## Code 401 Things I Want To Learn More About

- [ ] Using 'cursor' in Java.
- [ ] GENERICS: Implement them from the beginning, but I am still struggling with them so can [Oracle.com](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/index.html) [JavaPoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/generics-in-java) or [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/java-generics) help me.  
- [ ] Java Object Streams: What they are and how to use them ([Oracle.com](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/objectstreams.html)).  
- [ ] Android: Implementing and managing data from a DB [in a Spinner](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/controls/spinner).  
- [ ] Applying themes (style, color, etc) to Android UI, simply and easily.  
- [ ] When and why would I choose to develop in Java vs C# or Python e.g. for a project.  
- [ ] Wiring Repositories in Spring.  
- [X] Proper and efficient installation of a specified JDK in Linux: Use JetBrains Tools box for IntelliJ installations; Use DEB install for Linux without JetBrains; Use Zip for Windows, put files where you want them, update JAVAHOME reference.
- [X] [Handling exceptions and exception types](./code401-files/java-exceptions-scanner.html) in asynchronous programming in Java.  
- [X] JUnit Tests: Why do they pass by default, without asserts or any code? They would always fail otherwise.  
- [X] Spring MVC especially SQL and other DB APIs.  
- [X] Interfaces: See OOP, Inheritance, Interfaces (below).  
- [X] Trees and Decision Trees have perplexed me for a while I'd like to get over that.  
- [X] Configuring Linux and Windows to support "IDEA ." to open IntelliJ at current directory.

# Notes From Various Resources on ChartJS and Canvas API

[WebDesignerDepot.com article on chart-js](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2013/11/easily-create-stunning-animated-charts-with-chart-js/)  

Rather than using tables to display data, use charts!  
ChartJS makes creating and styling charts much easier.  

To get started with Chart.js:

1. Download it.
2. Copy Chart.min.js into your css folder.
3. Import Chart.min.js into your html page.

The `<canvas>` element is used to set a new chart on the page.  
Use `<script>` element to grab data for the chart.  
Associate the script data with canvas element via the id attribute in the canvas element.
Use a DOM query to find the chart element and store in a local variable.  
Instantiate a new Chart object using DOM query element as a parameter.  
Chart options are JSON data to set values and colors.
Line, Pie, and Bar charts were shown as baseline examples.
Chart animation is fairly straightforward, just set a property or two.

## Advice

Talk aloud as practice:

- get used to talking about yourself and promoting your skills, value  
- get used to talking through your logical thinking and problem solving processes  

Be curious!

- Ask those questions during interview and during on the job
- Research to learn more about tech, the company your are interested in, etc
- Seek opportunities outside of work to exercise your brain and technical expertice and learn new skills  
- Ask about long-term goals of projects, team, ... the company!  

Technical Interviews / Whiteboarding is more about the journey and the thought process than the destination, and this helps the interviewers understand your attention to detail, engagement, and problem-solving skills.  

Regarding Pay and Benefits / Offers: Ask around what others have been offered.

## Summary Comments

Many people do not do things they *could do* but don't have the confidence to *allow* them to do it.  
Historically: Experience builds confidence.  
Today: Not enough time for this, so confidence is a trainable skill!  
Myth: Either you have confidence as a personality trait, or you don't.
Upbringing plays a big part in confidence in adulthood.  
Personality *is not permanent*.  
Self doubt is poisonous: "That person over there has things that I do not."  
Confident leaders have fear and self-doubt like everybody else - they just act anyway.  
Through taking action, you *learn* that you *can* do things you haven't done before.

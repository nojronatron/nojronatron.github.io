## Summary Comments

Many people do not do things they *could do* but don't have the confidence to *allow* them to do it.  
Historically: Experience builds confidence.  
Today: Not enough time for this, so confidence is a trainable skill!  
Myth: Either you have confidence as a personality trait, or you don't.
Upbringing plays a big part in confidence in adulthood.  
Personality *is not permanent*.  
Self doubt is poisonous: "That person over there has things that I do not."  
Confident leaders have fear and self-doubt like everybody else - they just act anyway.  
Through taking action, you *learn* that you *can* do things you haven't done before.  
Difficult != Not Possible.  
The human brain *dislikes doing new things*.  
Human brain cannot distinguish the difference in dangers e.g. Bear Attacking vs. Presenting/performing in front of 1,000 people.  
Removing yourself from its comfort zone puts the brain into a different state, usually defense and heightened fear.  
Lizard-brain: Am I food or is that food? Freight, flight, or food?  
What about imposter syndrome? Social change is necessary, corporate changes too, but our brain is wired to "keep us safe", although it is a misguided thinking process.  

## Keys to Confidence

Choose to create confidence.  
Choose to *not* pay attention to your brain and not believe everything your brain is telling you.  

### TODOs to Build Your Confidence

Questions to ask myself:

Do I have trauma that needs professional assistance to work through?  

When was I most confident?  
When do you feel confident today?  
How does confidence feel in your body?  
How can I continue to take actions that will build my confidence?  
How can I prepare to make taking action a little less *scary*?  
Build confidence through failure (and be okay with the failure).  

Review these question *every week*:

What went well? One page of good things during the previous week.  
What didn't go well? Again, no more than 1 page.  
What would I do differently? Think about trying things differently if possible. At this point you can determine if the "didn't go well" are just "life" and things you don't have control over.  
Reward Yourself! When you complete something hard, follow it up with some positive emotional experience(s).

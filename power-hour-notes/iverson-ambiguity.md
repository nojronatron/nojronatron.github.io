## Ambiguity

"Open for interpretation"

Lack of communication: You must let others know what you are doing and thinking, in order to counteract ambiguity.

Undefined Problem Domain: Causes requirements to become ambiguous. Clients might not know what they want, so asking questions and communicating around the problem domain will help develop it.

Unclear Goal: If looking at a spec/user story/etc does not define the work that needs to be done to meet it, it is not a clear goal.

User stories should be refined into requirements for the current Sprint. Clarify User Stories regularly so that work items are well defined.

# Ambiguity in the Workplace

Ambiguity is *everywhere*! Documents, conversations... it is unavoidable. Here are tips on how to deal with it.

## Ambiguity

"Open for interpretation"

Lack of communication: You must let others know what you are doing and thinking, in order to counteract ambiguity.

Undefined Problem Domain: Causes requirements to become ambiguous. Clients might not know what they want, so asking questions and communicating around the problem domain will help develop it.

Unclear Goal: If looking at a spec/user story/etc does not define the work that needs to be done to meet it, it is not a clear goal.

User stories should be refined into requirements for the current Sprint. Clarify User Stories regularly so that work items are well defined.

In team collaboration (T-shooting, submitting requests, asking questions) there are plenty of opportunities for ambiguity to appear. My job is to ask questions and figure out the root cause of a problem, or what the actual ask is.

Remember: I am not comfortable reporting ambiguous information to my manager, so it is my responsibility to dis-ambiguate so that I can articulate details to others (and be productive).

Abiguity can result in:

- Low productivity
- Wasted time/effort
- Creating the wrong thing
- Inaccurate estimates
- Missed deadlines

Ask questions to:

- Determine what the starting point is.
- Discover what an "end state" might be.
- Determine "what type of" something is.
- Find out what "that thing looks like" to the requestor/client.

## Handling Ambiguity

Accept it. Learn to navigate it. Build-up tolerance for it.

Make uncomfortable decisions that might not be correct. It is *ok to fail*. Concentrate of *keeping moving forward*!

Communicate: Ask questions! State your assumptions *out loud*. Write-out your understandings so others can read and consume them, and provide feedback and corrections to your assumptions.

Keep your cool: Good decisions don't come from a place of stress.

## Mitigate Ambiguity

Daily Standups: For the team specifically. Talk to each other.

Documentation: Clarify in writing. Create a shared understanding.

Clarify Requirements: Example scenarios. Reword the requirement. Ask open-ended questions. Start a discussion around the requirement(s).

QA: Confirm functionality. Compare actual to what the requirements as asking for: User-acceptance testing.

Show the Client: Demo the project. Do it early so the client can provide feedback and any changes can be made early and quickly.

## Key Takeaways

- Do *not* assume that asking your question makes you look "dumb".
- Open conversations rather than be fearful of asking a question.
- Communicate MORE. Success in tech is *not possible* without asking questions, documenting ideas and expectations.
- Diagrams can be helpful for the speaker and/or the audience.
- Ask questions around input -> output. "If I give you input x, what would you expect the output to be?"
- Confidence Level: A personal/professional, or group-level confidence in being able to meet a requirement. Use this as a yard-stick to determine readiness, or if more questions and refinement is necessary.

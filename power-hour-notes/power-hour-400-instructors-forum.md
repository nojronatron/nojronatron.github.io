# Title

Ed Young-skav-a-yich Java and Dot NET
Jacob Knaack - javascript/MERN instructor, has used JS at several startups
JB Tellez - principal instructor and Python 401 instructor

## Jacob: JS 401

Prior to 401 mostly browser-based development
401 dev in Node, using Express, SQL Servers, ORMs
Talk to Node process in command line
How to test solutions
How to deploy
Discuss software as a system
Deeper into Express (server back-end building)
Sockets and real-time connections
Prevalent and useful design patterns
Part-two dives *very hard and deep* into React: Test, maintain, and scalable UIs
Midterm project: All server-side with auth, sockets, REST, etc
Final project: Front-end (with a back-end) with tests within a specified problem domain (of students choosing)

## Ed: Java 401

Not hot-new-ness
BUT most-popular back-end development code
Students and TA's often poached prior to completing Code Fellows
Cool Things:

- billions of libraries
- performant
- since Oracle took over, release cadence has increased
- Know Java? Getting a tutorial on C#
- More back-end, but not completely back-end
- Object oriented rather than script oriented
- Haskell, F#, OCamel are functional languages but not really discussed here
- Java has paid Ed's bills very well for 30+ years

1. 2 weeks learn Java
2. 2 weeks learn Spring* (server-side website development) (server-side rendering)
3. Midterm projects based on spring-mvc
4. Android *in* Java (but not so much Kotlin because it is niche)
5. AWS Amplify: Rapid Dev Framework, integrates AWS techs: S3, etc
6. Monitization, Analytics
7. Final project: Android Phone App!

## JB: Python 401

Python is on a good run
Readable, made to be fun => Please write readable code
Heavy emphasis on simple, explicity, and documentability
Python is becoming a strong data science language
Very common in back-end web development

## Ed: DotNET 401

Ed has done C# work as well
Similarities with Java
ASP.NET Core overview
Midterm
Focus on back-end, hook-up to React front-end
Unity! (instead of Android)

## Common Course Topics

### Data Structures and Algorithms

Jacob Knaack
Data structures and Algorithms => computer-sciency-approach discussions, lectures, and regularly used DS and A
Hypothesis, Diagram, Select Tools, Focus on behaviors to solve the problem, implement hand-made structures, testing the structures, etc

### Career Coaching

JB Tellez
Getting your resume in-gear so it gets looked at, not tossed
Job-hunting process
Not about doing the job, rather GETTING the job
How to nail an interview
Building your brand - how you are presenting yourself

## Q and A

TypeScript (mostly Jacob)

- Is part of the conversation but not part of the curriculum
- Popularity gains happened in last 4 years
- Does NOT mean the end of javascript
- Introduces type-safety to javascript
- Is starting to make inroads in the industry
- Is a good thing to look at but a JS dev is highly employable
- Ed mentioned issues with integrating with various frameworks so there are still some rough edges or not prepared for many common javascript scenarios
- JB says CodeFellows moves fast because the industry moves fast
- JB also stated that as demand increases, other languages and frameworks get introduced into CF curriculum at some level

JavaScript

Jacob state that nowadays javascript frameworks are very mature now and is a good thing to know to get going on other languages

Sifting Through Docs and Noise Working on Projects on your Own

Jacob: It's a skill and don't be discuraged when finding terrible documentation and use CTRL+F. Try to avoid reading 'good to know' stuff and focus on the 'this is what I need to know'
Ed: It's a skill and takes practice
JB: Can I test this? If so it will help you to learn the language features at the time you need them

HeadFirst *

Books with good learning methodology for many languages especially Java

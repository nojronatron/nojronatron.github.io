## Functions and Scripting

Turn problems into useful commands... and turn commands into tools!

Computational Advantage: Similar to a lever that simplifies moving a heavy load => "big results with little effort".

Computational Abstraction: Bundling sets of instructions and controlling, and minimizing external dependencies, and giving it a name.

Abstraction: Remove concern for details.

Pipes and Redirects (Windows and Linux, respectively) chain command inputs and output together.

Wrapping multiple functions and their input and outputs together is a process of *abstraction*.

Higher-level languages: More abstracted from the hardware (CPU, RAM, I/O).

Lower-level languages: "Closer" to the hardware, and generally less abstracted, and closer to binary coded instructions.

Write your code plans in Pseudocode so it is portable to any other language.

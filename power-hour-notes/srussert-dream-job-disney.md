Having camera on and interacting with classmates is part of networking.

Have a vision, do the work, and be critical.

Look at your strengths and weaknesses and challenge growth!

Talk about what you want - how else will people around you know and *help you*?

Keep your fire stoked and your interest high!

- Do at least 1 thing everyday that keeps the focus on the end goal

Do the best you can but take breaks!

Turn in incomplete work if you have to, and get back to it late as time permits.

Utilize TA's.

Soft/people skills can be transferred into software from other experiences/professions.

Be excited and enthusiastic about what you are doing, and will be doing!

Have tenacity, do not give up.

Be willing to seek solutions to problems on your own.

Sara's getting the job simplified workflow: Network; Prepare and Execute; Connect with the interview team pre/post interview.

Find out from the team you will interview with: How can I best prepare for my upcoming interview?

Know how to iterate through data of all types.

Know how to utilize conditional statements to dynamically respond to data as it comes in.

Problem solving: Develop ability to plan and verbally explain how I will approach a problem.

Talk while coding! Build on this skill so I will be able to do it during a technical interview.

## Seven Cs

- conversion
- courage
- conversation
- coordination
- consistency
- commitment
- cryptography

### Conversion

Translate your existing skill sets.

### Courage

Leap-of-faith go you here.

Keep pushing back on imposter syndrome!

Reach for roles that *appear* to be outside your grasp (they probably are withing your grasp).

In your next position advocate for yourself, and be sure to speak up when you see risk or alternatives so you bring value.

### Conversation

Bring you questions and conversations to your experiences.

Ask questions rather than go direct to declarative statements.

Be brave in asking questions!

Be inclusive and ensure equity in conversation and decision making.

### Coordination

Security belongs to the entire team, and is a service t othe business and it's users.

Work in coordinate with other business units - you can work ourside your role by reaching out and becoming part of the important conversations.

### Consistency

Tackle the hard problems by addressing complexity.

Consistency is not equivalent to never changing your mind.

Fail => Learn => Iterate: This consistent work will pay off.

DO THE WORK.

Show up consistently, keep trying, keep working on improvement.

### Confession

It is ok to say "I don't know".

Become comfortable being uncomfortable.

It is ok to reach out and say "I need help" and "I am stuck".

Maintain confidence in yourself to find the answers: 

- Searching the internet
- your network
- your manager
- your coworkers
- your team

"I don't know but this is where I would look..." -Brook mentioned this as an acceptable interview question response.

### Cryptography

Five primary functions of it:

- Authentication
- Integrity
- Key exchange
- Non-repudiation
- Privacy/Confidentiality

Bake-in security from the start rather than trying to add it later.

Symmetric Encryption: Same math used to ENcrypt and DEcrypt.

Asymmetric Encryption: Different Encryption than DEcryption math.

RSA is a well known Asymmetric encryption method that uses different keys.

Public key: Sender uses recipients' to encrypt their message.

Private key: The key you use to decrypt messages FOR YOU?

The enc-dec demonstration was *very good* in simplifying the asymmetric key math/operation!

## Closing Notes

Don't JUST focus on perfect code.

~~Soft skills~~ Human Skills MATTER!

Emotional intelligence matters!

Always have a growth mindset.

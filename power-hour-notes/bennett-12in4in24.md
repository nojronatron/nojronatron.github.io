## Takeaways

Smaller companies will require multiple hats wearers.

You must check out management and determine if there is a high turnover or other acidic issues:

- Who is the manager you will be reporting to?
- What about the manager above them?
- If _I_ am the manager and my people start leaving, _I_ am not doing a good job.

Tech jobs are _everywhere_ in the world!

Travelling and working in other countries will exand your thinking, feed creativity, and a different view on diversity and inclusivity.

Get pushed out of your comfort zone to get used to it, and get better handling them.

Burnout is read and self care is _vital_:

- Take care of yourself else ruin your health.
- Family and friends will also pay a toll.
- Burn-out comes very quickly when self-care is not happening.
- Burn-out will come quicker still when in a toxic environment.
- Battle burn-out by giving!

Tech is constantly changing:

- You _must_ be ready to change with it!
- Not always your choice, sometimes up to your employer or business.
- Learn _how to learn_ and keep it going to keep up with the tech stack.

Beware of money-money-money orientated jobs:

- If money is everything, then _nothing else matters_.
- This can lead to a very toxic environment.
- _Beware_ getting pulled into these toxic behaviors!

Culture is more important than money:

- Culture eats money for breakfast.
- Tech will pay good money.
- If the culture is bad, is the money worth it?
- If the culture is good, will the earnings matter as much?
- Cross-reference any self-proclaimed great-culture pronounciations with profiles of people that work(ed) there (e.g. LinkedIn).

How to stand out in the field?

- Write blog posts.
- Schedule talks on what you are passionate about.
- Contribute to OSS.
- Make YouTube videos.
- Include these contributions in your CV.

For first job:

- You will need support! Big companies will have this.
- Smaller companies: You will need to inquire about how to become productive rapidly: "What is my on-boarding experience?"

Reach out on LinkedIn:

- It is okay to ask some of the employees via LinkedIn about the job.
- Use local events and social media to discover company culture.

Learning a New Language:

- In a stagnant role? Look into a new language as an option.
- In a role where older tech is in use? Look into a new language as an option.
- Excited about a technology? Start right away, find others that are passionate and knowledgable about it for support when you need it.

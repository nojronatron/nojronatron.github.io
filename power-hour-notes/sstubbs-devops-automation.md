# Intro To DevOps and Automation

## Introduction

Sharina Stubbs

CodeFellows Java grad!

Use of AWS Cloud too

## Automation

Minimize manual effort.

Reduce liklihood of human-introduced error.

Humans should innovate and create!

Pipeline: Code and systems that execute programmatic steps *with just a button push*.

Automation is a part of the concept of DevOps.

## Microservices and Serverless Architecture

Microservices: Different services are unique and isolated.

Check out AWS's Microservices page.

Serverless:

- Services that abstract-away the server itself.
- Usage is charged rather than buying a server outright.
- SNS & S3 are serverless services.

Check out AWS's Serverless Architecture page.

Lambda Function:

- Stores code for later execution.
- Like a pipeline.
- Requires permissions to interact with other AWS Services.
- "The duct tape of the internet"

SNS, S3, and Lambda are very inexpensive services.

EC2 costs are much higher so progress with caution.

## Interacting with AWS

Built on API calls.

Interact with services via AWS-CLI.

## DevOps

Dev Teams: Implement the feature.

Ops Teams: Test and support the feature/solution.

Problem: Devs build code but might not support it, and inheritors must address issues in code they didn't write/not familiar with.

Solution:

- The Philosophy and practice of DevOps.
- Use of tools to support developer to own code through most or all of the code lifecycle.
- Provide platform to automate steps to build, test, deploy, alert, etc.

Agile Environments:

- DevOps helps support agility in teams.
- Plan, write, build, test, release, deploy, operate, and monitor ... CODE.

Many goals and practices in DevOps:

- Automation
- Agile Work Environments
- Microservices architecture
- Continuous Itegration
- Condituous delivery/deployment
- Infrastructure as Code
- Monitoring and Logging
- Collaboration and Communication

DevOps can be difficult to get into:

- Probably not a first-job.
- Get a job as a back-end engineer.
- Build-out your own projects.
- Work with coworkers asking for help etc.

PSE: Platform Systems Engineering

- Don't design or build apps.
- Support other teams doing that for us.

## Q and A

IAM Profiles (users) are limited, however you can grant Administrative rights.

The most commonly used service in AWS is S3. EC2 is also incredibly popular. Lambda is also quite popular.

## Resources

Using an Amazon S3 trigger to invoke a Lambda Function.

Download and configure the AWS CLI.

Boto3: Language to interact with the S3 infrastructure.

GitLab on devops.

Builtin.com software engineering perspectives.

CloudGuru: Classes walk users through AWS fundamentals. Try starting with Cloud Practitioner

## Advice Going Forward

Have Tenacity.

Learn and be curious.

Bias towards action.

Have a growth mindset.
